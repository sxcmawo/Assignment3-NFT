**NextNFT - A Next.js & Solidity ERC721 Token Project**

NextNFT is a comprehensive project that encapsulates the creation of an app with Ethereum's blockchain technology. The project involves writing a Solidity smart contract for an ERC721 token (a standard for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain) and developing a Next.js application as the frontend interface to interact with the blockchain.

**Features**
ERC721 Token: Implementation of a standard non-fungible token contract allowing operations like minting tokens and transferring ownership.
Next.js Frontend: A user-friendly web interface created with Next.js, facilitating seamless interaction with the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
Wallet Integration: Users can easily connect their Ethereum wallets to interact with the dApp (decentralized application).
NFT Minting: Users can mint new NFTs directly from the web interface, which are then reflected on the blockchain.
NFT Gallery: A visual display of NFTs minted through the smart contract, showcasing ownership and other token details.

**Project Structure**
The project is divided into two main parts:

Smart Contract Development: Located in the ethereum directory, it contains the Solidity smart contract code for the ERC721 token, along with migration scripts for deploying to the Ethereum network.

Next.js Frontend: Located in the next-nft directory, it holds the code for the frontend application, including pages for connecting an Ethereum wallet, minting NFTs, and viewing the NFT gallery.
